Rome Wasnt Built With Gulp
==========================

A talk on all things [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp). The talk contained more than what's in the slides. I built these slides with Gulp and I spent some time showing how I used `gulp-markdown`, `gulp-front-matter` and `through` in particular. 


## Building the slides

1. `npm run setup`
2. `cult`
